#OBJECTIVE: Explore the National Emissions Inventory database 
#and see what it say about fine particulate matter pollution 
#in the United states over the 10-year period 1999â€“2008. 
#You may use any R package you want to support your analysis.
#
#
#QUESTION 1: Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased 
#in the United States from 1999 to 2008?
#
#Plotting system: BASE
#
#OUTPUT: plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources
#for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008

#FINAL STEP: CALL BASE PLOTTING COMMANDS
#
#Use TApply to calculate Emission means by year in NEI
